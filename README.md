Strong encryption and decryption node js

strong-cryptor is lightweight utility to manage strong encryption and decryption with **aes-256-cbc** algorithm, strong-cryptor not using any depedencies, idea behind this project is to
avoid the same pattern every encrypted data that can be learned by attacker and make it easy to decrypted by the attacker.

with strong-cryptor every encryption process will have different result, even the data is same

## Whats new in v2.x.x

in this version there is no separator needed, so it's will make the encryption more secure

## Basic Concept

Concept behind **strong-cryptor** is to create randomize IV(Initial Vector) in every encryption process, and embed the IV to the
result of encryption process

| Command         | Result                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| encrypt('test') | a0aade621f5e00dd21.... |
| encrypt('test') | d0dac814ee1f11be08.... |

## Installation

```bash
npm i strong-cryptor
```

or

```bash
yarn add strong-cryptor
```

## Example Usage

### Encryption

```ts
/**
 * your can simply encrypt your data like this
 */
import { encrypt } from 'strong-cryptor'
const KEY = 'AHBSGTEUET125STSGBDHDJKXMPLKIU12' // must be 32 characters
const text = 'Hello guys, i am just plain text'
const encryptedText = encrypt(text, KEY, 'hex')
console.log(encryptedText)
// a0aade621f5e00dd21543ad2b229620d0acfa794e2ac705670be3650f0566e697569b22c138006f0d3fbb7618dd5efa2881b48bf3a9baa70b864ca0cc9e0b568
```

### Decryption

```ts
/**
 * and when you try to decrypt, make sure that `encoding` and `key` that you pass is same with the encryption prosess before
 */
import { decrypt } from 'strong-cryptor'
const decryptedText = decrypt(encryptedText, KEY, 'hex')
// Hello guys, i am just plain text
console.log(decryptedText)
```
